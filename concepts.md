High-level design / Low-level design
: High-level design : explains the architecture that would be used to develop a system. Low-level design is a component-level design process that follows a step-by-step refinement process, this process can be used for designing data structures, required software architecture, source code and ultimately, performance algorithms.

Column-based database / Row-based database

Relational database / Document-oriented database
: ...

Pub-Sub ~ Publish-Subscribe ~ Broker ~ Message queue
: implementation of publish-subscribe as a service

Sharding
: ...

Distributed consensus
: ...
Types: 2PC, 3PC, SAGA

Replication strategy

Split brain
: failure when more than single component believes it is a master

Sharding
: a database architecture pattern related to horizontal partitioning — the practice of separating one table’s rows into multiple different tables, known as partitions.

CAP Theorem
: in theoretical computer science, the CAP theorem, states that any distributed data store can provide only two of the following three guarantees.
